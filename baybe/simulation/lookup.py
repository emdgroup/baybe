    """Add/fill target values in a dataframe using a lookup mechanism.

    Note:
        This does not create a new dataframe but modifies ``queries`` in-place.

    Args:
        queries: The dataframe to be modified. Its content must be compatible with the
            chosen lookup mechanism.
        targets: The targets whose values are to be looked up.
        lookup: The lookup mechanism. Can be one of the following choices:

            -   A dataframe mapping rows of ``queries`` to the corresponding target
                values. That is, it must contain the same columns as ``queries`` plus
                one additional column for each of the given target.
            -   A callable, providing target values for each row of ``queries``.
            -   ``None``. Produces fake values for all targets.
        impute_mode: Specifies how a missing lookup will be handled. Only relevant for
            dataframe lookups. Can be one of the following choices:

            - ``"error"``: An error will be thrown.
            - ``"worst"``: Imputes the worst available value for each target.
            - ``"best"``: Imputes the best available value for each target.
            - ``"mean"``: Imputes the mean value for each target.
            - ``"random"``: A random row will be used for the lookup.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an unsupported lookup mechanism is provided.

    Example:
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> from baybe.targets.numerical import NumericalTarget
        >>> from baybe.simulation.lookup import look_up_targets
        >>>

        >>> df = pd.DataFrame({"x": [1, 2, 3]})
        >>> lookup_df = pd.DataFrame({"x": [1, 2], "target": [10, 20]})
        >>> look_up_targets(df, targets, lookup_df, impute_mode="mean")
        >>> print(df)
           x  target
        0  1    10.0
        1  2    20.0
