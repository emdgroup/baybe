    """Simulate a Bayesian optimization loop.

    The most basic type of simulation. Runs a single execution of the loop either
    for a specified number of steps or until there are no more configurations left
    to be tested.

    Args:
        campaign: The DOE setting to be simulated.
        lookup: The lookup used to close the loop, providing target values for the
            queried parameter settings.
            For details, see :func:`baybe.simulation.lookup.look_up_targets`.
        batch_size: The number of recommendations to be queried per iteration.
        n_doe_iterations:  The number of iterations to run the design-of-experiments
            loop. If not specified, the simulation proceeds until there are no more
            testable configurations left.
        initial_data: The initial measurement data to be ingested before starting the
            loop.
        random_seed: An optional random seed to be used for the simulation.
        impute_mode: Specifies how a missing lookup will be handled.
            For details, see :func:`baybe.simulation.lookup.look_up_targets`.
            In addition to the choices listed there, the following option is available:

            -   ``"ignore"``: The search space is stripped before recommendations are
                made so that unmeasured experiments will not be recommended.
        noise_percent: If not ``None``, relative noise in percent of
            ``noise_percent`` will be applied to the parameter measurements.

    Returns:
        A dataframe ready for plotting, see the ``Note`` for details.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If a non-suitable lookup is chosen.
        ValueError: If the impute mode ``ignore`` is chosen for non-dataframe lookup.
        ValueError: If a setup is provided that would run indefinitely.

    Note:
        The returned dataframe contains the following columns:

        * ``Iteration``:
          Corresponds to the DOE iteration (starting at 0)
        * ``Num_Experiments``:
          Corresponds to the running number of experiments performed (usually x-axis)
        * for each target a column ``{targetname}_IterBest``:
          Corresponds to the best result for that target at the respective iteration
        * for each target a column ``{targetname}_CumBest``:
          Corresponds to the best result for that target up to including
          respective iteration
        * for each target a column ``{targetname}_Measurements``:
          The individual measurements obtained for the respective target and iteration
