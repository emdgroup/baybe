    """Select a subset of points using farthest point sampling.

    Creates a subset of a given collection of points by successively adding points with
    the largest Euclidean distance to intermediate point selections encountered during
    the algorithmic process. The mechanism used for the initial point selection is
    configurable.

    Args:
        points: The points that are available for selection, represented as a 2-D array
            of shape ``(n, k)``, where ``n`` is the number of points and ``k`` is the
            dimensionality of the points.
        n_samples: The total number of points to be selected.
        initialization: Determines how the first points are selected:
            * ``"farthest"``: The first two selected points are those with the
              largest distance. If only a single point is requested, a deterministic
              choice is made based on the point coordinates.
            * ``"random"``: The first point is selected uniformly at random.

    Returns:
        A list containing the positional indices of the selected points.

    Raises:
