# Example for creating campaigns from configs

This example shows how to load a configuration file and use it to create a campaign.
In such a configuration file, the objects used to create a campaign are represented by
strings. We use the following configuration dictionaries, representing a valid campaign.

Note that the json format is required for the config file.
You can create such a config by providing a  dictionary with `"type":"name of the
class"`.

## Necessary imports


```python
from baybe import Campaign
```

## The configuration dictionary as a string

Note that the following explicit call `str()` is not strictly necessary.
It is included since our method of converting this example to a markdown file does not
interpret this part of the code as `python` code if we do not include this call.


```python
CONFIG = str(
    """
{
    "searchspace": {
        "constructor": "from_product",
        "parameters": [
            {
                "type": "CategoricalParameter",
                "name": "Granularity",
                "values": [
                    "coarse",
                    "fine",
                    "ultra-fine"
                ],
                "encoding": "OHE"
            },
            {
                "type": "NumericalDiscreteParameter",
                "name": "Pressure[bar]",
                "values": [

                ],
                "tolerance": 0.2
            },
            {
                "type": "SubstanceParameter",
                "name": "Solvent",
                "data": {
                    "Solvent A": "COC",

            }
        ],
        "constraints": []
    },
    "objective": {
        "type": "SingleTargetObjective",
        "target":
            {
                "type": "NumericalTarget",
                "name": "Yield"
            }
    },
    "recommender": {

## Creating a campaign from the configuration file

Although we know in this case that the config represents a valid configuration for a
campaign. If the config is invalid an exception will be thrown.


```python
campaign = Campaign.from_config(CONFIG)
```

We now perform a recommendation as usual and print it.


```python
recommendation = campaign.recommend(batch_size=3)
print(recommendation)
```

       Granularity  Pressure[bar]    Solvent
    26  ultra-fine            1.0  Solvent C
    20        fine           10.0  Solvent A
    9       coarse           10.0  Solvent B
