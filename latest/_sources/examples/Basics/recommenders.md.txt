# Example for using different strategies

This example shows how to create and use recommender objects.
Such an object specifies the recommender adopted to make recommendations.
It has several parameters one can adjust, depending on the recommender the user wants to
follow.

To apply the selected recommender, this object can be specified in the arguments of the
campaign.
The different parameters the user can change are:
- The initial recommender
- The recommender with its surrogate model and its acquisition function
- Other parameters to allow or not repetition of recommendations

This examples assumes some basic familiarity with using BayBE.
We refer to [`campaign`](./campaign.md) for a more general and basic example.

## Necessary imports for this example


```python
from baybe import Campaign
from baybe.objectives import SingleTargetObjective
from baybe.parameters import NumericalDiscreteParameter, SubstanceParameter
from baybe.recommenders import (
    BotorchRecommender,
    RandomRecommender,
    TwoPhaseMetaRecommender,
)
from baybe.searchspace import SearchSpace
from baybe.surrogates import GaussianProcessSurrogate
from baybe.surrogates.base import Surrogate
from baybe.targets import NumericalTarget
from baybe.utils.basic import get_subclasses
from baybe.utils.dataframe import add_fake_measurements
```

## Available recommenders suitable for initial recommendation

For the first recommendation, the user can specify which recommender to use.
The following initial recommenders are available.
Note that it is necessary to make the corresponding import before using them.


```python
initial_recommenders = [
    "Random",  #: RandomRecommender(),
    "Farthest Point Sampling",  # FPSRecommender(),
    "KMEANS Clustering",  # KMeansClusteringRecommender(),
]
```

Per default the initial recommender chosen is a random recommender.


```python
INITIAL_RECOMMENDER = RandomRecommender()
```

## Available surrogate models

This model uses available data to model the objective function as well as the
uncertainty.
The surrogate model is then used by the acquisition function to make recommendations.

The following are the available basic surrogates:


```python
for subclass in get_subclasses(Surrogate):
    print(subclass)
```

    <class 'baybe.surrogates.custom.CustomONNXSurrogate'>
    <class 'baybe.surrogates.linear.BayesianLinearSurrogate'>
    <class 'baybe.surrogates.naive.MeanPredictionSurrogate'>
    <class 'baybe.surrogates.ngboost.NGBoostSurrogate'>
    <class 'baybe.surrogates.bandit.BetaBernoulliMultiArmedBanditSurrogate'>
    <class 'baybe.surrogates.gaussian_process.core.GaussianProcessSurrogate'>
    <class 'baybe.surrogates.random_forest.RandomForestSurrogate'>


Per default a Gaussian Process is used
You can change the used kernel by using the optional `kernel` keyword.


```python
SURROGATE_MODEL = GaussianProcessSurrogate()
```

## Acquisition function

This function looks for points where measurements of the target value could improve the
model.
The following acquisition functions are generally available.


```python
available_acq_functions = [
    "qPI",  # q-Probability Of Improvement
    "qEI",  # q-Expected Improvement
    "qUCB",  # q-upper confidence bound with beta of 1.0
    "PM",  # Posterior Mean,
    "PI",  # Probability Of Improvement,
    "EI",  # Expected Improvement,
    "UCB",  # upper confidence bound with beta of 1.0
]
```

Note that the availability of the acquisition functions might depend on the
`batch_size`:
  - If `batch_size` is set to 1, all available acquisition functions can be chosen
  - If a larger value is chosen, only those that allow batching.
      That is, 'q'-variants of the acquisition functions must be chosen.

The default acquisition function is q-Log Expected Improvement.


```python
ACQ_FUNCTION = "qLogEI"
```

## Creating the recommender object

To create the recommender object, each parameter described above can be specified as
follows.
Note that they all have default values.
Therefore one does not need to specify all of them to create a recommender object.


```python
recommender = TwoPhaseMetaRecommender(
    initial_recommender=INITIAL_RECOMMENDER,
    recommender=BotorchRecommender(
        surrogate_model=SURROGATE_MODEL, acquisition_function=ACQ_FUNCTION
    ),
)
```


```python
print(recommender)
```

    TwoPhaseMetaRecommender
       Initial recommender
          RandomRecommender
             Compatibility: SearchSpaceType.HYBRID
       Recommender
          BotorchRecommender
             Surrogate
                GaussianProcessSurrogate
                   Supports Transfer Learning: True
                   Kernel factory: DefaultKernelFactory()
             Acquisition function: qLogExpectedImprovement()
             Compatibility: SearchSpaceType.HYBRID
             Sequential continuous: True
             Hybrid sampler: None
             Sampling percentage: 1.0
       Switch after: 1
       Remain switched: False
       Has switched: False


## Example Searchspace and objective parameters

We use the same data used in the [`campaign`](./campaign.md) example.


```python
dict_solvent = {
    "DMAc": r"CC(N(C)C)=O",
    "Butyornitrile": r"CCCC#N",
    "Butyl Ester": r"CCCCOC(C)=O",
    "p-Xylene": r"CC1=CC=C(C)C=C1",
}
dict_base = {
    "Potassium acetate": r"O=C([O-])C.[K+]",
    "Potassium pivalate": r"O=C([O-])C(C)(C)C.[K+]",
    "Cesium acetate": r"O=C([O-])C.[Cs+]",
    "Cesium pivalate": r"O=C([O-])C(C)(C)C.[Cs+]",
}
dict_ligand = {
    "BrettPhos": r"CC(C)C1=CC(C(C)C)=C(C(C(C)C)=C1)C2=C(P(C3CCCCC3)C4CCCCC4)C(OC)="
    "CC=C2OC",
    "Di-tert-butylphenylphosphine": r"CC(C)(C)P(C1=CC=CC=C1)C(C)(C)C",
    "(t-Bu)PhCPhos": r"CN(C)C1=CC=CC(N(C)C)=C1C2=CC=CC=C2P(C(C)(C)C)C3=CC=CC=C3",
}
```


```python
solvent = SubstanceParameter("Solvent", data=dict_solvent, encoding="MORDRED")
base = SubstanceParameter("Base", data=dict_base, encoding="MORDRED")
ligand = SubstanceParameter("Ligand", data=dict_ligand, encoding="MORDRED")
temperature = NumericalDiscreteParameter(
    "Temperature", values=[90, 105, 120], tolerance=2
)
concentration = NumericalDiscreteParameter(
    "Concentration", values=[0.057, 0.1, 0.153], tolerance=0.005
)
```

We collect all parameters in a list.


```python
parameters = [solvent, base, ligand, temperature, concentration]
```

We create the searchspace and the objective.


```python
searchspace = SearchSpace.from_product(parameters=parameters)
```


```python
objective = SingleTargetObjective(target=NumericalTarget(name="yield"))
```

## Creating the campaign

The recommender object can now be used together with the searchspace and the objective
as follows.


```python
campaign = Campaign(
    searchspace=searchspace,
    recommender=recommender,
    objective=objective,
)
```

This campaign can then be used to get recommendations and add measurements:


```python
recommendation = campaign.recommend(batch_size=3)
print("\n\nRecommended experiments: ")
print(recommendation)
```

    
    
    Recommended experiments: 
               Solvent               Base                        Ligand  \
    397       p-Xylene  Potassium acetate  Di-tert-butylphenylphosphine   
    125  Butyornitrile     Cesium acetate                     BrettPhos   
    368       p-Xylene    Cesium pivalate                     BrettPhos   
    
         Temperature  Concentration  
    397         90.0          0.100  
    125        120.0          0.153  
    368        120.0          0.153  



```python
add_fake_measurements(recommendation, campaign.targets)
print("\n\nRecommended experiments with fake measured values: ")
print(recommendation)
```

    
    
    Recommended experiments with fake measured values: 
               Solvent               Base                        Ligand  \
    397       p-Xylene  Potassium acetate  Di-tert-butylphenylphosphine   
    125  Butyornitrile     Cesium acetate                     BrettPhos   
    368       p-Xylene    Cesium pivalate                     BrettPhos   
    
         Temperature  Concentration      yield  
    397         90.0          0.100  95.501676  
    125        120.0          0.153  21.329623  
    368        120.0          0.153  54.356597  



```python
campaign.add_measurements(recommendation)
```
