# Optimizing a Laser's Wavelength

In this example, we explore BayBE's capabilities for handling nonlinear
optimization problems. Specifically, we demonstrate the two fundamental types of
nonlinearities that can arise in optimization scenarios: known and unknown.
We investigate a setting where:
* we need to optimize a very specific **user-defined nonlinear** objective function of
  a target quantity,
* where the target quantity depends in a **nonlinear but unknown** way on a parameter
  controlled by the user.

## The Scenario

Imagine you're in a busy optics lab, preparing to tune a high-performance laser for a
critical experiment. Your goal is to align the laser's output wavelength to one of two
specific channels in a [wavelength-division
multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing) system.
Both channels lead to the same detector, making them functionally equivalent for your
measurements.

The laser's wavelength is controlled by the voltage applied to its tuning element;
however, this relationship is complex and nonlinear. It involves both linear drift
and nonlinear cavity mode effects, but you lack a precise analytical model.
Consequently, you turn to a data-driven optimization approach, with BayBE as your ally.

## The Laser Model

To demonstrate this scenario through simulation, we need to define the laser's
characteristics and system dynamics. In practice, this information would be unknown,
but for benchmarking our optimization approach, we assume realistic values to build
a black-box model.

First, we define the physical constants that characterize our laser:


```python
w0 = 1550.00  # unit: nm
alpha = 0.20  # unit: nm/V
A = 0.60  # unit: nm
P = 2.5  # unit: V
```

We also capture the relationship between the applied voltage and the emitted
wavelength in form of a lookup callable that can be used to close the simulation loop:


```python
def lookup(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """A lookup modelling the voltage-to-wavelength relationship of a tunable laser.

    This function captures both linear tuning and nonlinear cavity mode effects
    that are typical in real laser systems.
    """
    df["Wavelength"] = (
        w0 + alpha * df["Voltage"] + A * np.sin(2 * np.pi * df["Voltage"] / P)
    )
    return df
```

## The Optimization Problem

Now, let us define our voltage parameter:


```python
voltage = NumericalContinuousParameter("Voltage", [0, 10], metadata={"unit": "V"})
```

We can visualize how it affects the laser's output wavelength by querying the lookup:


```python
voltage_grid = np.linspace(*voltage.bounds.to_tuple(), 1000)
induced_wavelength = lookup(pd.DataFrame({"Voltage": voltage_grid}))["Wavelength"]
```


```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 10))
axs[0].plot(voltage_grid, induced_wavelength, color="tab:blue");
```


    
    


Our reference wavelengths for the two multiplexing channels and the acceptable
tolerance around each are defined as follows:


```python
wavelength1 = 1550.5  # unit: nm
wavelength2 = 1551.5  # unit: nm
sigma = 0.1  # unit: nm
```

Let us also add them to the plot so that we can easily see the optimal parameter
settings, that is, the voltages that generate these wavelengths:


```python
axs[0].axhline(wavelength1, color="tab:red");
axs[0].axhline(wavelength2, color="tab:red");
```

Our goal is to align the laser's output wavelength with either of the two reference
wavelengths, treating both wavelengths as equally desirable. We can express this
symmetric objective by creating "reward peaks" around each reference wavelength using
Gaussian-shaped functions. The tolerance parameter $\sigma$ controls the width of
these peaks, determining how precisely the laser must be tuned to achieve optimal
performance:

```{math}
\begin{equation*}
\text{Objective}(\lambda) =
  \exp\left(-\frac{(\lambda - \lambda_1)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
+ \exp\left(-\frac{(\lambda - \lambda_2)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
\end{equation*}
```

We can easily implement this mathematical objective in code using BayBE's
transformation framework. To do so, we start by creating a target variable that
lets us reference our observable quantity (the laser's output wavelength):


```python
wavelength = NumericalTarget("Wavelength", metadata={"unit": "nm"})
```

Using BayBE's ability to {ref}`compose transformations
<userguide/transformations:Composite Transformations>`, the optimization objective can
be imprinted onto the target using basic algebraic operations:


```python
wavelength1_peak = ((wavelength - wavelength1).power(2) / (2 * sigma**2)).negate().exp()
wavelength2_peak = NumericalTarget.match_bell(
    "Wavelength", wavelength2, sigma, metadata={"unit": "nm"}
)
target = wavelength1_peak + wavelength2_peak
```

For demonstration purposes, we use the
{meth}`~baybe.targets.numerical.NumericalTarget.match_bell` convenience constructor to
create the second peak, which yields a target object that is {ref}`mathematically
equivalent <userguide/transformations:Equality>` to that of the corresponding
algebraic construction. See our [transformation user
guide](/userguide/transformations) for more alternative construction routes.

Let us overlay the relationship between observed wavelength and objective value in the
existing plot:


```python
wavelength_grid = pd.Series(
    np.linspace(induced_wavelength.min(), induced_wavelength.max(), 1000)
)
induced_target = target.transform(wavelength_grid)
```


```python
ax2 = axs[0].twiny()
ax2.plot(induced_target, wavelength_grid, color="tab:orange");
ax2.set_xlabel("Objective Value", color="tab:orange");
ax2.tick_params(axis="x", labelcolor="tab:orange");
axs[0].set_xlabel(f"{voltage.name} ({voltage.metadata.unit})", color="tab:blue");
axs[0].set_ylabel(f"{target.name} ({target.metadata.unit})", color="tab:blue");
axs[0].tick_params(axis="x", labelcolor="tab:blue");
axs[0].tick_params(axis="y", labelcolor="tab:blue");
```

## Simulating the Optimization Loop

Finally, we encapsulate both the search space and objective in a BayBE
{class}`~baybe.campaign.Campaign`:


```python
campaign = Campaign(
    searchspace=voltage.to_searchspace(),
    objective=target.to_objective(),
)
```

In practice, we would iteratively query this campaign for voltage recommendations,
measure the resulting wavelengths, and provide feedback for refined recommendations.
Here, we simulate this closed-loop process using our black-box laser model:


```python
results = simulate_scenarios(
    {"Laser": campaign},
    lookup,
    n_doe_iterations=N_DOE_ITERATIONS,
    n_mc_iterations=N_MC_ITERATIONS,
)
```

    

    

    

    

    


## Results

Let us visualize the optimization process in the second subplot:


```python
sns.lineplot(
    data=results.rename(
        columns={
            "Wavelength_CumBest": "Wavelength (nm)",
            "Num_Experiments": "# Experiments",
        }
    ),
    x="# Experiments",
    y="Wavelength (nm)",
    hue="Monte_Carlo_Run",
    marker="o",
    ax=axs[1],
    legend=False,
)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```




The plot reveals trajectories converging to two distinct clusters,
corresponding to the two reference wavelengths $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. This
bimodal convergence occurs because both wavelengths – by construction – yield
identical objective values according to the applied transformation.

Each colored trajectory represents an independent Monte Carlo run of the optimization
process, showing how different random initializations converge to one of the two
equivalent optimal wavelengths without preferring one over the other. The early parts
of each trajectory show larger variation in wavelength values (exploration phase),
whereas the trajectories concentrate around the optimal wavelengths after several
experiments (exploitation phase). Notice how trajectories can still escape their
current basin of attraction in the hope of finding even better solutions in the
other basin, which demonstrates the algorithm's ability to find the global
optimum of the problem.
