# Example for linear constraints in a continuous searchspace

Example for optimizing a synthetic test functions in a continuous space with linear
constraints.
All test functions that are available in BoTorch are also available here.
This example assumes some basic familiarity with using BayBE.
We thus refer to [`campaign`](./../Basics/campaign.md) for a basic example.
Also, there is a large overlap with other examples with regards to using the test
function.
We thus refer to [`discrete_space`](./../Searchspaces/discrete_space.md) for
details on this aspect.

## Necessary imports for this example


```python
import os
```


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from botorch.test_functions import Rastrigin
```


```python
from baybe import Campaign
from baybe.constraints import ContinuousLinearConstraint
from baybe.parameters import NumericalContinuousParameter
from baybe.searchspace import SearchSpace
from baybe.targets import NumericalTarget
from baybe.utils.dataframe import arrays_to_dataframes
```

## Defining the test function

See [`discrete_space`](./../Searchspaces/discrete_space.md) for details.


```python
DIMENSION = 4
TestFunctionClass = Rastrigin
```


```python
if not hasattr(TestFunctionClass, "dim"):
    TestFunction = TestFunctionClass(dim=DIMENSION)
else:
    TestFunction = TestFunctionClass()
    DIMENSION = TestFunctionClass().dim
```


```python
BOUNDS = TestFunction.bounds
```

## Creating the searchspace and the objective

Since the searchspace is continuous test, we construct `NumericalContinuousParameter`s
We use that data of the test function to deduce bounds and number of parameters.


```python
parameters = [
    NumericalContinuousParameter(
        name=f"x_{k + 1}",
        bounds=(BOUNDS[0, k], BOUNDS[1, k]),
    )
    for k in range(DIMENSION)
]
```

We model the following constraints:
- $1.0*x_1 + 1.0*x_2 = 1.0$
- $1.0*x_3 - 1.0*x_4 = 2.0$
- $1.0*x_1 + 1.0*x_3 >= 1.0$
- $2.0*x_2 + 3.0*x_4 <= 1.0$ which is equivalent to $-2.0*x_2 - 3.0*x_4 >= -1.0$


```python
constraints = [
    ContinuousLinearConstraint(
        parameters=["x_1", "x_2"], operator="=", coefficients=(1.0, 1.0), rhs=1.0
    ),
    ContinuousLinearConstraint(
        parameters=["x_3", "x_4"], operator="=", coefficients=(1.0, -1.0), rhs=2.0
    ),
    ContinuousLinearConstraint(
        parameters=["x_1", "x_3"], operator=">=", coefficients=(1.0, 1.0), rhs=1.0
    ),
    ContinuousLinearConstraint(
        parameters=["x_2", "x_4"], operator="<=", coefficients=(2.0, 3.0), rhs=-1.0
    ),
]
```


```python
searchspace = SearchSpace.from_product(parameters=parameters, constraints=constraints)
target = NumericalTarget(name="Target", minimize=True)
objective = target.to_objective()
```

## Wrap the test function as a dataframe-based lookup callable


```python
lookup = arrays_to_dataframes(
    [p.name for p in parameters], [target.name], use_torch=True
)(TestFunction)
```

## Construct the campaign and run some iterations


```python
campaign = Campaign(
    searchspace=searchspace,
    objective=objective,
)
```

Improve running time for CI via SMOKE_TEST


```python
SMOKE_TEST = "SMOKE_TEST" in os.environ
```


```python
BATCH_SIZE = 2 if SMOKE_TEST else 3
N_ITERATIONS = 2 if SMOKE_TEST else 3
```


```python
for k in range(N_ITERATIONS):
    recommendation = campaign.recommend(batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)
    lookup_values = lookup(recommendation)
    measurements = pd.concat([recommendation, lookup_values], axis=1)
    campaign.add_measurements(measurements)
```

## Verify the constraints


```python
measurements = campaign.measurements
TOLERANCE = 0.01
```

$1.0*x_1 + 1.0*x_2 = 1.0$


```python
print(
    "1.0*x_1 + 1.0*x_2 = 1.0 satisfied in all recommendations? ",
    np.allclose(
        1.0 * measurements["x_1"] + 1.0 * measurements["x_2"], 1.0, atol=TOLERANCE
    ),
)
```

    1.0*x_1 + 1.0*x_2 = 1.0 satisfied in all recommendations?  True


$1.0*x_3 - 1.0*x_4 = 2.0$


```python
print(
    "1.0*x_3 - 1.0*x_4 = 2.0 satisfied in all recommendations? ",
    np.allclose(
        1.0 * measurements["x_3"] - 1.0 * measurements["x_4"], 2.0, atol=TOLERANCE
    ),
)
```

    1.0*x_3 - 1.0*x_4 = 2.0 satisfied in all recommendations?  True


$1.0*x_1 + 1.0*x_3 >= 1.0$


```python
print(
    "1.0*x_1 + 1.0*x_3 >= 1.0 satisfied in all recommendations? ",
    (1.0 * measurements["x_1"] + 1.0 * measurements["x_3"]).ge(1.0 - TOLERANCE).all(),
)
```

    1.0*x_1 + 1.0*x_3 >= 1.0 satisfied in all recommendations?  True


$2.0*x_2 + 3.0*x_4 <= 1.0$


```python
print(
    "2.0*x_2 + 3.0*x_4 <= 1.0 satisfied in all recommendations? ",
    (2.0 * measurements["x_2"] + 3.0 * measurements["x_4"]).le(1.0 + TOLERANCE).all(),
)
```

    2.0*x_2 + 3.0*x_4 <= 1.0 satisfied in all recommendations?  True
