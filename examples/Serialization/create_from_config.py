## Example for creating campaigns from configs

# This example shows how to load a configuration file and use it to create a campaign.
# In such a configuration file, the objects used to create a campaign are represented by
# strings. We use the following configuration dictionaries, representing a valid campaign.

# Note that the json format is required for the config file.
# You can create such a config by providing a  dictionary with `"type":"name of the class"`.

### Necessary imports

from baybe import Campaign

### The configuration dictionary as a string

# Note that the following explicit call `str()` is not strictly necessary.
# It is included since our method of converting this example to a markdown file does not
# interpret this part of the code as `python` code if we do not include this call.

CONFIG = str(

### Creating a campaign from the configuration file

# Although we know in this case that the config represents a valid configuration for a
# campaign. If the config is invalid an exception will be thrown.

campaign = Campaign.from_config(CONFIG)

# We now perform a recommendation as usual and print it.

recommendation = campaign.recommend(batch_size=3)
print(recommendation)
