## Example for using the multi target mode for the objective

# Example for using the multi target mode for the objective.
# It uses a desirability value to handle several targets.

# This example assumes some basic familiarity with using BayBE.
# We thus refer to [`campaign`](./../Basics/campaign.md) for a basic example.

### Necessary imports for this example

import pandas as pd

from baybe import Campaign
from baybe.objectives import DesirabilityObjective
from baybe.parameters import CategoricalParameter, NumericalDiscreteParameter
from baybe.searchspace import SearchSpace
from baybe.targets import NumericalTarget
from baybe.utils.dataframe import add_fake_measurements

### Experiment setup and creating the searchspace

Categorical_1 = CategoricalParameter("Cat_1", values=["22", "33"], encoding="OHE")
Categorical_2 = CategoricalParameter(
    "Cat_2",
    values=["very bad", "bad", "OK", "good", "very good"],
    encoding="INT",
)
Num_disc_1 = NumericalDiscreteParameter(
    "Num_disc_1", values=[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10], tolerance=0.3
)
Num_disc_2 = NumericalDiscreteParameter(
    "Num_disc_2", values=[-1, -3, -6, -9], tolerance=0.3
)

parameters = [Categorical_1, Categorical_2, Num_disc_1, Num_disc_2]

searchspace = SearchSpace.from_product(parameters=parameters)


### Defining the targets

# The multi target mode is handled when creating the objective object.
# Thus we first need to define the different targets.

# This examples has different targets with different modes.
# The first target is maximized and while the second one is minimized.
# Note that in this multi target mode, the user must specify bounds for each target.

Target_1 = NumericalTarget(
    name="Target_1", mode="MAX", bounds=(0, 100), transformation="LINEAR"
)
Target_2 = NumericalTarget(
    name="Target_2", mode="MIN", bounds=(0, 100), transformation="LINEAR"
)

# For each target it is also possible to specify a `target_transform` function.
# A detailed discussion of this functionality can be found at the end of this example.

# In this example, define a third target working with the mode `MATCH`.
# We furthermore use `target_transform="BELL"`.

Target_3 = NumericalTarget(
    name="Target_3", mode="MATCH", bounds=(45, 55), transformation="BELL"
)

# Note that the `MATCH` mode seeks to have the target at the mean between the two bounds.
# For example, choosing 95 and 105 will lead the algorithm seeking 100 as the optimal value.
# Thus, using the bounds, it is possible to control both the match target and
# the range around this target that is considered viable.


### Creating the objective

# Now to work with these three targets the objective object must be properly created.
# The mode is set to `DESIRABILITY` and the targets are described in a list.

targets = [Target_1, Target_2, Target_3]

# As the recommender requires a single function, the different targets need to be combined.
# Thus, a `scalarizer` is used to create a single target out of the several targets given.
# The combine function can either be the mean `MEAN` or the geometric mean `GEOM_MEAN`.
# Per default, `GEOM_MEAN` is used.
# Weights for each target can also be specified as a list of floats in the arguments
# Per default, weights are equally distributed between all targets and are normalized internally.
# It is thus not necessary to handle normalization or scaling.


objective = DesirabilityObjective(
    targets=targets,
    weights=[20, 20, 60],
    scalarizer="MEAN",
)

print(objective)

### Creating and printing the campaign

campaign = Campaign(searchspace=searchspace, objective=objective)
print(campaign)

### Performing some iterations

# The following loop performs some recommendations and adds fake results.
# It also prints what happens to internal data.

N_ITERATIONS = 3

for kIter in range(N_ITERATIONS):
    rec = campaign.recommend(batch_size=3)
    add_fake_measurements(rec, campaign.targets)
    campaign.add_measurements(rec)
    desirability = campaign.objective.transform(campaign.measurements, allow_extra=True)

    print(f"\n\n#### ITERATION {kIter + 1} ####")
    print("\nRecommended measurements with fake measured results:\n")
    print(rec)
    print("\nInternal measurement database with desirability values:\n")
    print(pd.concat([campaign.measurements, desirability], axis=1))

### Addendum: Description of `transformation` functions

# This function is used to transform target values to the interval `[0,1]` for `MAX`/`MIN` mode.
# An ascending or decreasing `LINEAR` function is used per default.
# This function maps input values in a specified interval [lower, upper] to the interval `[0,1]`.
# Outside the specified interval, the function remains constant, that is, 0 or 1.

# For the match mode, two functions are available `TRIANGULAR` and `BELL`.
# The `TRIANGULAR` function is 0 outside a specified interval and linearly increases to 1 from both
# interval ends, reaching the value 1 at the center of the interval.
# This function is used per default for MATCH mode.
# The `BELL` function is a Gaussian bell curve, specified through the boundary values of the sigma
# interval, reaching the maximum value of 1 at the interval center.
