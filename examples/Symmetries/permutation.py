# ## The Scenario

# We will explore a 2 dimensional function which is permutation-invariant. This means
# $f(x,y) = f(y,x)$. The function was crafted to exhibit no additional mirror symmetry
# (a common way of also resulting in permutation invariance) and have multiple minima.
# In practice, permutation invariance can arise e.g. for
# [mixtures when modeled with a slot-based approach](/examples/Mixtures/slot_based).
# BayBE supports other kinds of symmetries as well (not part of this example).

# There are several ways to handle such symmetries. The simplest one is
# to augment your data. In the case of permutation invariance, augmentation means for
# each measurement (x,y) you also add a measurement with switched values: (y,x).
# This has the advantage that it is fully model-agnostic, but might
# come at the expense of increased training time and efficiency due to the larger amount
# of effective training points. Other ways of treating symmetry, such as using special
# kernels for a GP, will not be discussed in this example.

# The first subplot shows the function we want to minimize. The dashed red line
# illustrates the permutation invariance, which is similar to a mirror-symmetry, just
# not along any of the parameter axis but along the diagonal. We can also see several
# local minima.

# Such a situation can be challenging for optimization algorithms if no information
# about the invariance is considered. For instance, if no
# {class}`~baybe.constraints.discrete.DiscretePermutationInvarianceConstraint` was used
# at all, BayBE would search for the optima across the entire 2D space. But it is clear
# that the search can be restricted to the lower (or equivalently the upper) triangle
# of the searchspace. This is exactly what
# {class}`~baybe.constraints.discrete.DiscretePermutationInvarianceConstraint` does:
# Remove entries that are "duplicated" in the sense of already being represented by
# another invariant point.

# If the surrogate is additionally configured with `symmetries` that use
# `use_data_augmentation=True`, the model will be fit with an extended set of points,
# including augmented ones. So as a user, you don't have to generate permutations and
# add them manually. Depending on the surrogate model, this might have different
# impacts. We can expect a strong effect for tree-based models because their splits are
# always parallel to the parameter axes. Thus, without augmented measurements, it is
# easy to fall into suboptimal splits and overfit. We illustrate this by using the
# {class}`~baybe.surrogates.ngboost.NGBoostSurrogate`.

# ## The Optimization Problem

p1 = NumericalDiscreteParameter("x", np.linspace(LBOUND, UBOUND, 51))
p2 = NumericalDiscreteParameter("y", np.linspace(LBOUND, UBOUND, 51))
objective = NumericalTarget("f", minimize=True).to_objective()

# We set up a constrained and unconstrained searchspace to demonstrate the impact of
# the constraint on optimization performance.

constraint = DiscretePermutationInvarianceConstraint(["x", "y"])
searchspace_plain = SearchSpace.from_product([p1, p2])
searchspace_constrained = SearchSpace.from_product([p1, p2], [constraint])

print("Number of Points in the Searchspace")
print(f"{'Without Constraint:':<35} {len(searchspace_plain.discrete.exp_rep)}")
print(f"{'With Constraint:':<35} {len(searchspace_constrained.discrete.exp_rep)}")

# We can see that the searchspace without the constraint has more points than the other
# two. This is the effect of the utilized
# {class}`~baybe.constraints.discrete.DiscretePermutationInvarianceConstraint`,
# filtering entries that are degenerate due to the permutation symmetry. As a result,
# the optimization will only be performed within the lower triangle of the first
# subplot.

# BayBE can automatically perform this augmentation if configured to do so.
# Specifically, surrogate models have the `Surrogate.symmetries` attribute. If any of
# these symmetries has `use_data_augmentation=True` (enabled by default),
# BayBE will automatically augment measurements internally before performing the model
# fit. To construct symmetries quickly, we use the `to_symmetry` method of the
# constraint.

# We find that the campaigns utilizing the permutation invariance constraint
# perform better than the ones without. This can be attributed simply to the reduced
# number of searchspace points they operate on. However, this effect is rather minor
# compared to the effect of symmetry.

# Furthermore, there is a strong impact on whether data augmentation is used or not,
# the effect we expected for a tree-based surrogate model. Indeed, the campaign with
# constraint but without augmentation is barely better than the campaign not utilizing
# the constraint at all. Conversely, the data-augmented campaign has a clearly superior
# performance. The best result is achieved by using both constraints and data
# augmentation.
